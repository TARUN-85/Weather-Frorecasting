Its a analysis of Weather Data using SQL...

Subtask 1: Correct years for given data set     
Subtask 2: removal of duplicate rows and duplicate Columns
Subtask 3: fix a few labels in the given data set 
Subtask 4: Encoding data into suitable format

The dataset we used in this project was populated using a scraping technique, the encoding method may be different; 
we prefer UTF-8 encoding as it is majorly used in all the database servers. To do so, perform the below tasks:
1. In the menu bar of excel, select option data. Then select from text/CSV and choose the file in which you made changes using excel
2. The default file origin will be UTF -8. Keep all the field as it is and select load
3. Save the file as CSV(comma-delimited) file.
4. Import the file into your SQL database 
(Analyze the dataset with respect to your database system and then change it, if necessary).
